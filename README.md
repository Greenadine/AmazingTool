# AmazingTool
A Java-based helper application for the "Amazing"-challenge at Windesheim University of Applied Sciences for the "Object-Oriented Software Design and Development" semester of the academic year of 2022-2023.

It contains the following helper tools:
- "Twenty" syntax checker (custom programming language provided for the challenge)
- Glade solver

This application was never fully finished, as the glade solver is missing the following key features:
- Exporting/importing glades
- Solving the glade
